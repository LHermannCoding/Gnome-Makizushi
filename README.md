# Gnome: Makizushi by LHermannCoding
This is the repository used for Gnome: Makizushi, my summer 2024 coding project. I created this project because I was motivated to make my first solo game project, and wanted to continue to develop my pygame skills because of how much fun I had while creating checkers. All of the code and assets are publicly available in this repository for viewing.

### Dedication:
I dedicate this game to my girlfriend, who was there from the beginning to the end of this project and pushed me to keep on gnoming even when the coding challenges were tough. I would also dedicate this game to my brother, who achieved the first ever Gnome: Makizushi sub 30s $200 profit speedrun with a time of 27.81 seconds. Finally, I dedicate this game to the goons, whose whimsy and creativity truly embody the gnome spirit I was trying to recreate.


### Assistance: 
While this game was entirely a solo project, the YouTubers **Coding with Russ** and **Clear Code** had multiple helpful tutorials I watched for assistance with things like game states, image masking, and sprite animation.


### Gameplay: 
The core gameplay concept is inspired by the **_Overcooked_** franchise, which I have had a lot of fun playing with my girlfriend before deciding that I would attempt to create my own type of top-down cooking simulator.


### Art: 
All art assets were created by me. I used **Piskel**, the free online sprite editor, to create all of the the pixel art.


### Sound: 
Most sound effects were created by me using the **SFXR** software. One sound clip that occurs when serving an incorrect order was taken from [this soundboard](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/11084-gordon-ramsay-soundboard.) The song I used in the tutorial was [Mii Channel 8 Bit Remix by Bubly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyXiGbYeebo&t=0s). The song I used in the main gameplay loop was [Yasuha - Flyday Chinatown [ 8bits Version ] by PRYMA9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni10svqLKhg&t=0s).
