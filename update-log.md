# Update Log
## Track pathway of what is added and changes in major updates to Gnome: Makizushi

## 1.1:
Customers are now impatient! Each customer placard will showcase a line clock, with a moving blot to represent how long they have been waiting in line. If you wait too long to serve the customer, they will walk away from the counter, and you may need to use the trashbin in the righthand side to prepare for a new dish.
This change was implemented to prevent a gameplay pattern of disregarding customers with dishes in more tedious kitchen locations (shrimp, unagi). Also, the player will have more of an understanding for the amount of payment they get from an ordering being based upon how long it takes to serve as a inverse multiplier. Further, I wanted to add a sense of subtle urgency to the kitchen (so the customers are happy, of course).

Bug fix: Fixed bug where holding down multiple inputs when pressing start button could break gnome sprite movement in tutorial.
